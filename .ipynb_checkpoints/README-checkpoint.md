# conways-game-of-life

Fun lil project coding Conway's game of life in python

After completing this I'd maybe like to screw around with the rules or make a different game of life. Also maybe I'll add in some cool visual fx...



### How to run

- Navigate into the folder you just downloaded
- Run the command belowin the terminal and the game will start up :)
- python conways-game-of-life.py


### To run just the algorithm

- Run this:
- python algorithm.py

- You will see the output from running 6 rounds of the game of life on a small array
